## Introduction

Backend module for remote storages

The mod-remote-storage module provides API for:
  * storing and retrieving all remote-storages settings
  * setting the remote-storage for the location from UI
  * adapter modules

## Additional information

API provides the following URLs for working with remote storage configurations:

| Method | URL| Permissions | Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | /remote-storage/configurations  | remote-storage.configurations.item.post | Creates a remote storage configuration |
| GET | /remote-storage/configurations | remote-storage.configurations.collection.get   | Retrieves all remote storage configurations |
| GET | /remote-storage/configurations/{configurationId} | remote-storage.configurations.item.get | Retrieves a remote storage configuration by id |
| PUT | /remote-storage/configurations/{configurationId} | remote-storage.configurations.item.put | Updates a remote storage configuration |
| DELETE | /remote-storage/configurations/{configurationId} | remote-storage.configurations.item.delete | Deletes a remote storage configuration by id |

API provides the following URLs for working with mappings between Folio locations and remote storage configurations (one-to-one):

|  Method | URL| Permissions  | Description  |
